roborobo3
=========

Roborobo! is a fast and simple 2D mobile robot simulator written in C++ loosely based on a khepera/epuck model. It is targeted for fast single and multi-robots simulation (primary motivation is evolutionary robotics et swarm/collective robotics).

Roborobo3 is currently the __only__ supported version.
